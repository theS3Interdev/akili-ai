## Application Features

This is a high-level view of how the Akili SaaS application features and how they are expected to work.

1.  **User Registration and Authentication:** Users can sign up or log in to the Akili platform using their email or social media accounts. Upon registration, users can choose a subscription plan that suits their needs (if applicable).

2.  **Dashboard:** Upon logging in, users are directed to their personalized dashboard. The dashboard provides an overview of the available AI tools: image generation, video generation, code generation, and conversation.

3.  **Image Generation:** Users can access the "Image Generation" tool from the dashboard. They input parameters such as style, subject, and other preferences. The AI processes the inputs and generates images based on the specified criteria. Users can preview and download the generated images.

4.  **Video Generation:** Similarly, users can access the "Video Generation" tool. They provide input like theme, duration, and desired content. The AI generates video content accordingly, incorporating images, animations, and text. Users can review, edit, and export the generated videos.

5.  **Code Generation:** The "Code Generation" tool assists developers with writing code snippets. Users describe the functionality they need in natural language. The AI suggests code snippets or even entire functions based on the description. Developers can refine and integrate the suggested code into their projects.

6.  **Conversation:** The "Conversation" tool offers an AI-powered chatbot interface. Users input questions or prompts, and the AI responds with relevant answers. The chatbot can also handle more complex conversations, providing information and assistance.

7.  **Integration and Export:** Users have the option to integrate the generated content directly into their projects. The application provides export options for images, videos, and code snippets. Exported content is tailored to user specifications and ready for use.

8.  **Settings and Account Management:** Users can manage their account settings, subscription plans, and preferences. They can also view their usage history and manage billing information.

9.  **Support and Feedback:** The application offers customer support through a help center or chatbot. Users can provide feedback, report issues, and seek assistance when needed.
